# PyCh

PyCh is a Python package based on SimPy for discrete-event simulation.
It is a tool developed for the course "Analysis of production systems" (4DC10).
PyCh is a port of [Chi3](https://cstweb.wtb.tue.nl/chi/trunk-r9682/).

# Important
**The project is currently set to public, to make testing with mybinder easier. However, in its current state, this project cannot be shared with students, as it contains the notebook files with the answers for the assignment. It is important that before the course starts a separate github project is created without any answers.**

## How to install
...

## Python dependencies
Pych requires the following packages: 'simpy', 'numpy', 'matplotlib.pyplot' and 'dataclasses'.

For faster simulation, PyCh can be used with [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/).

## Contents
- 'src/PyCh' contains the source code of the package
- 'notebooks' contains the jupyter notebooks used in the course
- 'examples' contains some simulation examples in python 

## Jupyter notebooks
The jupyter notebooks used in this project can be tested in [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Nickp1993/PyCh/HEAD)

Note, to test the notebooks in Mybinder.org: rename ".PyCh.py" to "PyCh.py" in the notebooks folder
