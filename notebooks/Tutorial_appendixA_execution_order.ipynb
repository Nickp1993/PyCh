    "Processes can be running parallel at the same time. If multiple processes generate an event simultaneously,\n",
    " the event which was scheduled first goes first (the event is scheduled as soon as the process reaches the `yield` statement). In the below example, we compare two models. In `model1` we first define process `P1` and then process `P2`. The reverse is done in `model2` . As we can see in the example, when events are scheduled simultaneously, the event of the process which was defined first is executed first (process `P1` in `model1`, and process `P2` in `model2`) ."
