    "Pych has been designed for modeling and analyzing systems with many components, all working together to obtain the total system behavior. Each component exhibits behavior over time. Sometimes they are busy making internal decisions, sometimes they interact with other components. The language uses a process to model the behavior of a component (the primary interest are the actions of the component rather than its physical representation). This leads to models with many processes working in parallel (also known as concurrent processes), interacting with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another characteristic of these systems is that the parallelism happens at different scales at the same time, and each scale can be considered to be a collection of co-operating parallel working processes.For example, a factory can be seen as a single component, it accepts supplies and delivers products. However, within a factory, you can have several parallel operating production lines, and a line consists of several parallel operating machines. A machine again consists of parallel operating parts. In the other direction, a factory is a small element in a supply chain. Each supply chain is an element in a (distribution) network. Depending on the area that needs to be analyzed, and the level of detail, some scales are precisely modeled, while others either fall outside the scope of the system or are modeled in an abstract way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all these systems, the interaction between processes is not random, they understand each other and exchange information. In other words, they communicate with each other. Pych uses channels to model the communication. A channel connects a sending process to a receiving process, allowing the sender to pass messages to the receiver. This chapter discusses parallel operating processes only, communication between processes using channels is discussed in Chapter 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed above, a process can be seen as a single component with behavior over time, or as a wrapper around many processes that work at a smaller scale. Pych supports both kinds of processes."
