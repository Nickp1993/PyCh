    "# 9 Buffers\n",

    "\n",
    "Using channels, entities can be transfered from one process to the next, in a synchronous manner (Sender and receiver perform the communication at exactly the same moment in time, and the communication is instantaneous). In many systems however, processes do not use synchronous communication, they use asynchronous communication instead. Entities (products, packets, messages, simple tokens, and so on) are sent, temporarily stored in a buffer, and then received.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the decoupling of sending and receiving is very important, it allows compensating temporarily differences between the number of items that are sent and received (Under the assumption that the receiver is fast enough to keep up with the sender in general, otherwise the buffer will grow forever or overflow).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the exchange of items from a producer process `P` to a consumer process `C` as shown in the figure below. In the unbuffered situation, both processes communicate at the same time.\n",
    "This means that when one process is (temporarily) faster than the other, it has to wait for the other process before communication can take place.\n",
