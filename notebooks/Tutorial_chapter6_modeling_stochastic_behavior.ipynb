    "Many processes in the world vary a little bit each time they are performed. Setup of machines goes a bit faster or slower, patients taking their medicine takes longer this morning, more products are delivered today, or the quality of the manufactured product degrades due to a tired operator. Modeling such variations is often done with stochastic distributions. A distribution has a mean value and a known shape of variation. By matching the means and the variation shape with data from the system being modeled, an accurate model of the system can be obtained. We use the `numpy.random` library, which has many stochastic distributions available. This chapter explains how to use them to model a system, and lists a few commonly used distributions. \n",

A discrete distribution is a distribution where only  specific values can be drawn, for example throwing a dice gives an integer number.

The constant distributions are discrete distributions that always return the same value. They are useful during the development of the model.

    "\n",
    "A (pseudo-)random number generator is used to create stochastic results instead. It starts with an initial *seed*, an integer number (you can give one at the start of the simulation). From this seed, a function creates a stream of `random` values. When looking at the values there does not seem to be any pattern. It is not truly random however. Using the same seed again gives exactly the same stream of numbers. This is the reason to call the function a `pseudo`-random number generator (a true random number generator would never produce the exact same stream of numbers). A sample of a distribution uses one or more numbers from the stream to compute its value. The value of the initial seed thus decides the value of all samples drawn in the simulation.\n",
