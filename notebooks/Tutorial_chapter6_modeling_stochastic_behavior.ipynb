    "Many processes in the world vary a little bit each time they are performed. Setup of machines goes a bit faster or slower, patients taking their medicine takes longer this morning, more products are delivered today, or the quality of the manufactured product degrades due to a tired operator. Modeling such variations is often done with stochastic distributions. A distribution has a mean value and a known shape of variation. By matching the means and the variation shape with data from the system being modeled, an accurate model of the system can be obtained. We use the `numpy.random` library, which has many stochastic distributions available. This chapter explains how to use them to model a system, and lists a few commonly used distributions. \n",

    "Simulating a model with stochastic behavior at a computer is however not stochastic at all. Computer systems are deterministic machines, and have no notion of varying results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A (pseudo-)random number generator is used to create stochastic results instead. It starts with an initial \\emph{seed}, an integer number (you can give one at the start of the simulation). From this seed, a function creates a stream of `random` values. When looking at the values there does not seem to be any pattern. It is not truly random however. Using the same seed again gives exactly the same stream of numbers. This is the reason to call the function a `pseudo`-random number generator (a true random number generator would never produce the exact same stream of numbers). A sample of a distribution uses one or more numbers from the stream to compute its value. The value of the initial seed thus decides the value of all samples drawn in the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "While doing a simulation study, performing several experiments with the same initial seed invalidates the results, as it is equivalent to copying the outcome of a single experiment a number of times. On the other hand, when looking for the cause of a bug in the model, performing the exact same experiment is useful as outcomes of previous experiments should match exactly."
