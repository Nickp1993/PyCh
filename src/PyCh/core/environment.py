"""
The SimPy Environment is extended with the execute and select functions.
These are used to make simulation in SimPy more similar to Chi.

These execute function is used to execute a communicator.
E.g. Environment.execute( Channel.receive() )
Which executes a receive task.

The select function is used to execute ONLY one of the given communicators, 
When one is executed, the other communicators all are aborted.
E.g. Environment.select( Channel.receive(), Channel.send(entity) )
Which executes EITHER a receive or a send.
